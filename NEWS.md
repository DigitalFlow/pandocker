Pandocker 18.06 is out !
================================================================================

What is this ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pandocker is a docker image containing a complete document production toolchain.
It allows you to generate slides and documents using `pandoc`, but without
installing the required depencies on your machine.

For instance to generate an EPUB file from a markdown source, you can simply
type:

```
docker run --rm -v `pwd`:/pandoc dalibo/pandocker:stable test.md -o test.epub
```

This image is available under BSD Licence and it is designed to work without
specific templates.

The project has 2 main branchs:

* `dalibo/pandocker:stable` should be used in production ( = 18.06 )
* `dalibo/pandocker:latest` is the development version

You can also retrieve images by their version number : `dalibo/pandocker:18.03`,
`dalibo/pandocker:17.12`, etc.

* Docker Hub : <https://hub.docker.com/r/dalibo/pandocker/>



What's new in version 18.06 ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Pandocker spricht Deutsch

We added support for german charset.


### Beware of for depracated parameters

Since version 18.03, we're using Pandoc 2 and it introduced 2 incompatibilities:

* `--latex-engine` is now named `--pdf-engine`
* `--no-tex-ligatures` is replaced by `--from=markdown-smart`

We added a wrapper that automatically supports both pandoc 1.x and
2.x parameters, but in the long run you should consider updating your
compilation flags.


How to upgrade
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```                                                                                                                               
docker pull dalibo/pandocker:stable
```

What's new in version 18.03 ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### We switched to Pandoc 2

Pandoc 2 was released in october 2017 and brings tons of great new features.
It also introduce a few incompatibilities as some parameters have been abruptly
renamed:

* `--latex-engine` is now named `--pdf-engine`
* `--no-tex-ligatures` is replaced by `--from=markdown-smart`

Hopefully we added a wrapper that automatically supports both pandoc 1.x and
2.x parameters, but in the long run you should consider updating your
compilation flags.


### We lost weight

The size of the previous image was 1.2GB (uncompressed). We reduced this to
735MB. We stripped down the image by removing a lot of unused LaTeX packages.
If you're missing one, please fill a bug report here :

<https://github.com/dalibo/pandocker/issues>

### Beamer is Back !

We restored the beamer export mode. You can simply get PDF slides like this:

```
docker run --rm -v `pwd`:/pandoc  dalibo/pandocker:stable -t beamer foo.md - o foo.beamer.pdf
```
